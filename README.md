# abl-devices
Personal (unofficial) Ableton Live 10 custom Python devices.

# Purpose
I will attempt to create various device scripts for favourite VSTs with the purpose of providing a more interactive and user-friendly interface for them on my Push 2 controller.

As of now, we can only midi-map certain parameters and save them in an Instrument Rack, which is useful, but lacks operability in an actual live scenario, or even in a studio use-case, for that matter.
